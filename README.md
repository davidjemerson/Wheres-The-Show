# Where's the Show?

### Welcome to Where's the Show!

On this website, you can search upcoming shows by location and date. Your search will return results for the next 2 weeks from the date selected. Upon clicking an artist name, the html will show a link to buy tickets to the event, the date of the show, th venue, and a thumbnail that's linked to a YouTube video from each artist so you can get acquainted with that artist's music.

For this project, we used the TicketMaster API, Google Maps API, and YouTube API. We also utilized Materialize for CSS and minor Javascript visuals.

Credit goes to Jack Ragland for concept, Zack Muenz for design, HTML, and CSS, and David Emerson for javascript development.
